NAME
    RT-Extension-ShowTransactionSquelching - Show which users were squelched
    per transaction

DESCRIPTION
    RT allows you to "squelch" which users should not be notified about a
    transaction. The information about which email addresses were squelched
    is not readily available from the ticket history, however; this
    extension adds that information.

RT VERSION
    Works with RT 4.2.

INSTALLATION
    perl Makefile.PL
    make
    make install
        May need root permissions

    Edit your /opt/rt4/etc/RT_SiteConfig.pm
        Add this line:

    Clear your mason cache
            rm -rf /opt/rt4/var/mason_data/obj
